# Xbox Controller Emulator
Emulate an Xbox controller from your mobile device to your PC  

Demonstration video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWrYsfU78Cs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWrYsfU78Cs)  

Note: Some controls are missing, such as a dpad, and buttons for emulating when you press down on a thumbstick.  

## How to use
Install python with pip.  

Run `pip install vgamepad` in a terminal.  
 
 Run the Server.py file. Two links will show up in the output. Go to the one that **DOESN'T** have 127.0.0.1 in it on your mobile device. You may have to disable your firewall on your PC to access the page.  

You should now be able to use the controls on your device and it will be emulated on your PC.
